## An R package for processing biodiversity data

This package was intended for processing biodiversity data, specifically for creating rank abundance graphs and comparing biodiversity assemblages with abiotic parameters. This R package will clean your data and will use your data to generate plots, histograms, linear regressions, and ANOVAs. This package was created for a biological data analysis class.
